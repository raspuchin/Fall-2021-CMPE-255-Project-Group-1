# Fall-2021-CMPE-255-Project-Group-1

This is our group project for CMPE 255.

### Abstract

The general aim for this project is to read compare different classification metrics on a dataset of our choosing.

We combined the One million reddit jokes dataset and highlights from the CNN dailymail dataset and marked them as 1 for jokes and -1 for not jokes. (Everything from reddit was considered a joke and highlights from cnn/dailymail was considered to not be one).

### Description

This problem is a binary classification problem. After preprocessing the data we will test a variety of different classification models to determine which model works best. 

The models we will test are:

- SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- KNN Classifier
- Neural Network
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging/Boosting
- Naive Bayes

We will use the same metrics for each model to compare them.

The classification metrics used to compare models will be:

- F1-Score
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
