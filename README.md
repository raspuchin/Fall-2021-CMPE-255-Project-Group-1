# Fall-2021-CMPE-255-Project-Group-1

This is our group project for CMPE 255.

### Abstract

The general aim for this project is to read compare different classification metrics on a dataset of our choosing.

We combined the One million reddit jokes dataset and highlights from the CNN dailymail dataset and marked them as 1 for jokes and -1 for not jokes. (Everything from reddit was considered a joke and highlights from cnn/dailymail was considered to not be one).
